# Guess my number
Guess my number is a game project that uses Javascript,HTML5 and CSS. This was a project for the course "The complete javascript course" in Udemy.

The main goal of this game is to find the number that is selected randomly each time the game is reset. The user has 20 points at the beginning of the game and get a penalty of -1 point each time he makes a wrong guess. The user gets a hint window that states if the number he guessed is higher or lower compared to the random number he is supposed to guess. Also, there is a highscore functionality.
